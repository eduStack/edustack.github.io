7月26日 The Next Generation Join us for an inside look at the next generation of Scratch — and a discussion of how Scratch is opening new opportunities for the next generation of children around the world.
Flat Scratch Jam: Computational Tinkering with Handmade Scratch Sprites Computational Tinkering infuses digital environments with real-world materials. In this workshop, inspired by Dreamfeel’s flatgame jams, we’ll spend time drawing, crafting, and collaging scenes and characters. We’ll then photograph and import these handmade sprites and backdrops into Scratch and experiment with adding them to approachable and open ended projects. At the end of the session, we’ll share our work and reflect together about how combining tangible materials with programming can affect learning outcomes.
Physical Computing with Scratch on the Raspberry Pi Break out of the screen and control the outside world with Scratch and the Raspberry Pi! In this hands-on workshop, you’ll learn how to use Scratch on the Raspberry Pi to connect LEDs, motors, and other output devices, and how to respond to physical inputs such as buttons and infrared sensors.

Can we code, stitch and share embroidered designs and patterns from around the world to open cultural conversations while teaching the literacy of coding? This panel will bring together Scratch educators who have been using Turtlestitch with students in four continents. We will talk about both our shared and unique experiences and how these can inform new modes of teaching and development. We will invite the audience to contribute ideas about the different cultural, social and educational contexts of all potential users.</p>
<h4 id="helping-students-discover-and-express-themselves-with-scratch-and-robotics">Helping Students Discover and Express Themselves with Scratch and Robotics</h4>
<p>Explore how Scratch and robotics can help students find a place and purpose in computer science. Many students do not know how computer science can help them make a difference in the world. In this panel, you’ll hear the perspectives from middle school, high school, and university faculty, as well as middle school and high school students, regarding their experiences using Scratch and Hummingbird robotics for meaningful project work. Check out student projects and start conversations about how you can support learners in expressing their knowledge, identities, and concerns across content areas.</p>

<h4 id="what-are-they-learning">What Are They Learning?</h4>
<p>The goal of this session is to expand the conversation about what and how young people learn with Scratch. We will explore research and evaluation strategies that extend beyond analyzing which coding blocks learners are using, focusing more attention on how young people develop broader skills and interests as they create, collaborate, and contribute to the Scratch community. We will also discuss whether effort placed on proving what young people are learning detracts effort away from improving their learning experiences and opportunities.</p>
<h4 id="brainpop-3-scratch-weaving-coding-into-the-curriculum">BrainPOP &lt;3 Scratch: Weaving Coding Into the Curriculum</h4>
<p>Interested in trying out coding with your students, but not sure where to start?

Creative Coding provides an easy on-ramp to bring coding into math, social studies, health, arts, science… whatever topics you’re exploring. In this session, you’ll explore this new feature, then brainstorm ways you might use it with your learners. BYOD!</p>
<h4 id="project-management-from-design-to-showcase">Project Management from Design to Showcase</h4>
<p>Managing a group of students working on individual Scratch projects is complicated. Sometimes big creative ideas need to meet tight time constraints. Welcome to project management. In this session, we will look at elementary student game design documents and find ways to support the conversion of these documents into working Scratch projects. We will discuss issues that come up during different stages of the process, and how to help students to better communicate their ideas and manage their time.</p>
<h4 id="omg-atoms-to-bits-code-a-story-using-your-own-lasercut-wooden-character">OMG Atoms to Bits! Code a Story Using Your Own Lasercut Wooden Character!</h4>
<p>Join youth facilitators and technology educators in creating handicraft characters and converting them into animated Scratch sprites. You’ll pick lasercut wooden pendants to paint, decorate, and customize (perhaps with a photo of your face!). Then you’ll turn these wooden “atoms” into “bits” with the help of a green screen, digital illustration software, and Scratch.</p>
<h4 id="looking-under-the-hood-of-scratch-30">Looking Under the Hood of Scratch 3.0</h4>
<p>Geek out with some of the creators of Scratch 3.0 to look “under the hood” and talk about how the latest version of Scratch was designed and engineered.
